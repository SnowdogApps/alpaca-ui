# Alpaca UI

Set of Vue3 components based on TailwindCSS.

What's included:

- Vite with Vue and TS support
- TailwindCSS
- histoire - to showcase and document components.
- ESLint + Prettier with basic setup

In the first step we will focus on building UI components that are easy to copy and past to the project. In the next step we will think over how to automate this process.
